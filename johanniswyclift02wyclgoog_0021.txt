increase in size‚ the whole universe would become larger than it can
possibly be. l'et rarefaction must be admitted; and a like argument has
the same weight as regards condensation. ll'yclil, in his reply, at once

declares that he does not admit the possibility ol a body occupying

more or lcss space without gain or loss os matter. Rarelacti0n‚ there·
lore, and condensation also, arc ‹lenied in this sense, but admitted in
another. On account ol the accession or the removal ol another body,
a substance may seem to increase or ‹liminish in size3 as, v. g., smoke
seems to spread itscll out and lill a room, whereas it is in reality mixed
with the air, This is the only sense in which rarefaction is possible,
and it answcrs all the objections. ll'e need not lolhrw our author through
